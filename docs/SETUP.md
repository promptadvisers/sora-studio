## Troubleshooting

### Server won't start?
```bash
# Make sure the script is executable
chmod +x start-server.sh

# Try running directly
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### API key not working?
- Make sure your key starts with `sk-`
- Check there are no extra spaces
- Verify the key is valid at https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

### Browser shows empty page?
- Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows/Linux) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac)
- Check browser console for errors (F12)
- Make sure you're accessing `http://localhost:8000` not `file://`
