## Technical Details

### Video Preview Implementation

```javascript
async loadGalleryVideoPreview(videoId) {
    const blob = await this.client.downloadContent(videoId);
    const videoUrl = URL.createObjectURL(blob);

    container.innerHTML = `
        <video
            class="w-full h-full object-cover"
            autoplay
            loop
            muted
            playsinline
            onmouseover="this.muted=false"
            onmouseout="this.muted=true"
        >
            <source src="${videoUrl}" type="video/mp4">
        </video>
    `;
}
```

**Key attributes:**
- `autoplay` - Starts playing automatically
- `loop` - Repeats indefinitely
- `muted` - Starts without audio (for autoplay to work)
- `playsinline` - Plays inline on mobile (no fullscreen)
- `object-cover` - Fills container while maintaining aspect ratio
- `onmouseover/out` - Toggle audio on hover

---

### Logo Click Implementation

```html
<div
    class="flex items-center space-x-3 cursor-pointer hover:opacity-80 transition"
    onclick="app.switchTab('create')"
>
    <!-- Logo content -->
</div>
```

**CSS classes:**
- `cursor-pointer` - Shows clickable cursor
- `hover:opacity-80` - Fade effect on hover
- `transition` - Smooth animation

## User Experience Flow

### Gallery Visit:
1. Click "Gallery" tab
2. See loading spinners on all cards
3. Videos load one by one (parallel)
4. Videos start playing automatically (muted)
5. Hover over any video to hear audio
6. Move mouse away to mute again

### Navigation:
1. Click "Sora Studio" logo anytime
2. Instantly return to Create Video tab
3. Start creating a new video

---

## Performance Considerations

### Video Loading:
- Videos load in **parallel** (not sequential)
- Uses `Promise.all()` for efficiency
- Each video is independent
- Failed videos show fallback icon (play button)

### Memory Management:
- Videos use `blob:` URLs (temporary)
- Browser manages memory automatically
- Videos are lightweight (4-8 seconds)
- Object URLs cleaned up when needed

### Mobile Compatibility:
- `playsinline` attribute for iOS/Android
- Videos don't open fullscreen
- Hover = tap on mobile
- Optimized for touch devices

---

## Browser Compatibility

### Autoplay Support:
âœ… Chrome 53+ (with muted)
âœ… Firefox 66+ (with muted)
âœ… Safari 11+ (with muted)
âœ… Edge 79+ (with muted)

**Note:** Autoplay with audio requires user interaction (that's why we start muted).

### Hover Audio:
âœ… Desktop: Hover to unmute
âœ… Mobile: Tap to unmute
âœ… Touch devices: First tap unmutes, second tap opens details

---

## Customization Options

You can adjust these behaviors in the code:

### Change autoplay settings:
```javascript
// Remove loop
<video autoplay muted playsinline>

// Start with audio (may not autoplay)
<video autoplay loop playsinline>

// Disable autoplay
<video loop muted playsinline>
```

### Change hover behavior:
```javascript
// Click to toggle audio instead of hover
onclick="this.muted = !this.muted"

// Always play with audio
// Remove muted attribute
```
